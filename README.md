# qualimed-hospitals

This project aims to provide a list of the nearest Swiss hospitals from a certain specialty annotated with different quality indicators. The typical user is a patient without a medical education.
The provided quality indicators are released by the Federal Office of Public Health FOPH. The site administrator should be able to add new variables/indicators and specialties in a generic fashion without rewriting the application.
